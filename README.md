# AirBnB clone - The console

## Project Description
This is the first part of the AirBnB clone project. It focuses on the console

### The command interpreter
The interface of the application is just like the Bash shell except that this has a limited number of accepted commands that were solely defined for the purposes of the usage of the AirBnB website.

This command line interpreter serves as the frontend of the web app where users can interact with the backend which was developed with python OOP programming.

Some of the commands available are:
- show
- create
- update
- destroy
- count
- help (shows available commands)

And as part of the implementation of the command line interpreter coupled with the backend and file storage system, the folowing actions can be performed:
-   Creating new objects (ex: a new User or a new Place)
-   Retrieving an object from a file, a database etc…
-   Doing operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)
-   Updating attributes of an object
-   Destroying an object


### Installing

Clone the repository of the project from Github:

  ```
  git clone https://github.com/jzamora5/AirBnB_clone.git
  ```

### Running

The console will display a prompt (hbnb) indicating that the user can write and execute a command. After the command is run, the prompt will appear again a wait for a new command. This can go indefinitely as long as the user does not exit the program.

  ```
  $ ./console.py
  (hbnb) 
  (hbnb) help
  
  Documented commands (type help <topic>):
  ========================================
  EOF  help  quit
  
  (hbnb) 
  (hbnb) 
  (hbnb) quit
  $
  ```
